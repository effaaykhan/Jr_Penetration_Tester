Q2: You attack an organisation and steal their data, what type of hacker would you be?
Ans: Black Hat

Q3: What document defines how a penetration testing engagement should be carried out?
Ans: Rules of Engagement

TASK 3: PENETRATION TESTING METHODOLOGIES

Penetration tests can have a wide variety of objectives and targets within scope. Because of this, no penetration test is the same, and there are no one-case fits all as to how a penetration tester should approach it. 

The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology. A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand. For example, having a methodology that you would use to test the security of a web application is not practical when you have to test the security of a network.



OSSTMM
The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
Wired Networks
Wireless communications



OWASP
The "Open Web Application Security Project" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.
The foundation regularly writes reports stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.



NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.
The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.




NCSC CAF
The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.
The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

Data security
System security
Identity and access control
Resiliency
Monitoring
Response and recovery planning

Q1: What stage of penetration testing involves using publicly available information?
Ans: Information Gathering

Q2: If you wanted to use a framework for pentesting telecommunications, what framework would you use? Note: We're looking for the acronym here and not the full name.
Ans: OSTMM

Q3: What framework focuses on the testing of web applications?
Ans: OWASP




TASK 4: BLACK-BOX, WHITE-BOX, GREY-BOX PENETRATION TESTING

Black-Box Testing
This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. This testing can involve interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned. No knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.
Black-Box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.




Grey-Box Testing
This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes.The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.
With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.




White-Box Testing
This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.
The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.


Q1: You are asked to test an application but are not given access to its source code - what testing process is this?
Ans: Black Box 

Q2: You are given access to the source code - what testing process is this?
Ans: White Box
